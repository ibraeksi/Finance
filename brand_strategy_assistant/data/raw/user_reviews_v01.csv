With easy approval and no credit checks for most purchases, it gives quick access to flexible payment options right at checkout. The 2-week plan (Pay in 4) splits your total into four interest-free payments — great for managing smaller buys. For bigger expenses, Klarna’s monthly plans let you pay over time, sometimes with 0% interest, making budgeting easier.

f7874fd5-ee6b-48c1-a8e5-17bc6fd33416,this app is bad. Bought clothing from a company that ended up being counterfeit. the biz owed me $86 and only gave $30. I notified klarna since I made payment through them. for nearly 2 months they said they're investigating the purchase. I go into detail showing pics of merchandise and talks with the seller. they saw how bad the items look and say I still have to pay the $56 for bad product because they can't make bad sellers refund. why waste 2 months of my time when u do nothing?,1,159,25.26.248,2025-07-01 19:56:09,"Hi, we deeply apologize for this as this is not the experience we want our customers to have.

Id strongly prefer you push for 2FA through other apps. Using an authenticator apps means that I could safely verify my account without remembering a random pin that goes with nothing else. Its not realistic. Instead, what youll find most doing is using parts of their other pins already in use. Does that really promote safety?
