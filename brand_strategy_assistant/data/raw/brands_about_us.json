    "Klarna": "\nHej, we\u2019re Klarna\nWe\u2019re here to set the new standard for how people shop and pay\u2013proudly Swedish.\n\nSmarter shopping starts here\nAt Klarna, we're redefining the shopping experience to help people get more out of their money. Here's how:\nPay your way: Choose from interest-free payment plans and customizable payment options.\nEarn while you shop: Receive cashback directly in your Klarna balance.\nSecure shopping: Keep your data safe using advanced encryption and 24/7 fraud monitoring.\nOur History\nMade in Stockholm\nThree young Swedish entrepreneurs had a brilliant idea back in 2005\u2014but not the best name. Kreditor became Klarna in 2010.\nUnicorn status unlocked\nIn 2012, Klarna reached a significant milestone with a $1B+ valuation, recognizing our rapid growth and market impacts.\nKlarna's family grows\nIn 2014, Klarna acquired SOFORT, creating Europe\u2019s fastest-growing online payments group.\nA bold new era\nIn 2017, Klarna transformed from blue to bold pink, and secured a full banking license, expanding our capabilities to serve customers.\nThe Klarna app arrives\nLaunched in 2018, the Klarna app provides users with tools for smarter shopping, budget management, and seamless payments across online and in-store experiences.\nThe smart spending leader\nAs of 2025, Klarna is a leader in digital payments, offering flexible payment options, cashback, and financial tools to millions of shoppers worldwide.\n\nThe numbers don't lie\n100m\nactive consumers\n\n720k\nM erchants\n\n2.9m\ntransactions per day\n\n26\nC ountries supported\n\nTrusted by the world's most loved brands\n\nMeet the board\nThe board is Klarna\u2019s top decision-making body, overseeing strategy, operations, and corporate governance to ensure accountability to both the organization and investors.\n\nGet to know our culture\nWith offices around the world, our global team blends start-up energy with a drive to create bold, impactful change and redefine smarter spending.\n\nTen years in the UK\nKlarna launched in the UK in 2014, inventing the modern BNPL market from a small rented office in Covent Garden. Credit card companies and traditional banks had been exploiting customers with sky-high interest rates and rip-off fees for too long.\n\nKlarna is different. We are a global payments network and shopping assistant that offers fairer, more sustainable solution ways to access credit.\n\nWe provide a seamless and secure shopping experience that helps our customers save time, save money, and worry less.\n\nAfter ten years in the UK, Klarna has been used by 18 million UK consumers and we liked London so much that we moved Klarna\u2019s global holding company, Klarna Group Plc, here. The BNPL industry we helped to create is estimated to have saved British consumers \u00a3470 million in credit card interest payments in the ten years since Klarna entered the UK.\n\nHere, we are publishing our facts and figures with full transparency, including age demographics, repayment rates, and late fee rates, to demonstrate that interest-free BNPL leads to better consumer outcomes than traditional credit.  Where credit card companies had to be forced by the FCA to publish complaint rates, we are doing so voluntarily.\n\n\nStart\nConsumer debt statistics\nThe beginning of sustainable payments\nOur payment products\nAny late payment is a failure on us\nKlarna's late payment statistics\nLate fees encourage on time payments\nKlarna BNPL > Credit Cards\nEveryone uses Klarna\nOur consumers love us\nComplaints statistics\nSources\n\nKlarna = a fairer alternative to spiraling credit debt\nKlarna is well known as a leader in \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later\u201d but as the industry faces heavy criticism around offering predatory credit products to consumers, it is more important than ever for us to show how we are inherently different in our credit offerings from both the traditional financial services and the BNPL industry at large.\n\n5% vs 50%\nIn 2023, 60% of Klarna\u2019s interest free products were paid off in full early, 35% on time and just 5% were late. While credit card users struggle to pay off their monthly balance in full with half (50.1%) of credit card balances incurring interest.\n\n\u00a370bn\nOutstanding credit card debt has increased by 9.2% and is now at an all time high at almost \u00a370bn and with credit card interest rates at their highest in 27 years according to Bank of England data, UK consumers are looking for more sustainable payment alternatives.\n\n0.4%\nWhile the Bank of England reports that default rates for credit cards continue increase, Klarna\u2019s default rate has never been lower at 0.4%.\n\nWikipink_UK_10_years_addition\nConsumer debt is lower than ever\nTen years after Klarna launched BNPL in the UK, consumer credit relative to income is lower than ever.\n\nAccording to the Resolution Foundation, Brits owe about 12% of their total disposable income, less than at any time since 2004.\n\nCredit cards remain the biggest problem in credit, but brits are falling out of love with them\nCredit cards are by far the biggest consumer credit product in the UK, used by 64% of Brits, followed by bank overdrafts. Over the past ten years, Brits have been slowing down their use of credit cards. As a result, credit card debt has fallen as a percentage of total consumer debt Brits spent \u00a3243bn on their credit cards in the year to May 2024 and 17% of UK consumers carry a credit card balance over from one month to the next, racking up interest (revolvers). This makes credit card companies a lot of money. They have charged UK consumers \u00a363bn in interest in the past 10 years, and are one of the most expensive consumer credit products, accounting for 32% of outstanding balances but 39% of interest payments.\n\nShare of adults holding credit card products\nShare of adults holding credit card products (%)\nCredit card balance share of net consumer lending\nCredit card balance share of net consumer lending\nBNPL is better for consumers\nOn almost every measure, BNPL leads to better consumer outcomes than credit cards.\n\nCredit cards make Brits spend more often and run up bigger debts than on BNPL. Consequently it takes four times longer to pay off a typical credit card debt and you are 40% more likely to fall behind on credit card payments.\n\nThis is because interest-free BNPL is a short-term loan, fully funded by the retailer. A BNPL provider maximises its revenue by lending money to people who will pay it back as quickly as possible, so it can lend that money out to another consumer.\n\nSo Klarna is incentivized to do everything they can to help consumers pay back on time, or even early.\n\nA credit card company earns nearly all its revenue from consumer interest. It maximises its revenue by lending money to people who pay it back late, after the interest-free period has expired.\n\nSo credit card companies are incentivised to encourage consumers to delay repayments and make the minimum possible payment.\n\nuk wikipink\nBNPL is helping consumers kick the credit card habit\nFor 44% of Brits, BNPL has helped reduced their credit card usage by \u2018a fair amount\u2019, \u2018a great deal\u2019 or \u2018completely\u2019.\n\ncredit card holders switch to bnpl\nThe beginning of fair and sustainable payment methods\nSince Klarna\u2019s founding in 2005 and our UK launch in 2014 we have been redefining the shopping and payment experience making it more secure, transparent and frictionless for all our customers. Our business model is focussed on charging retailers, not consumers. We take our responsibility as a lender very seriously and have not waited for regulation of the BNPL sector before introducing a number of measures to help protect customers. This includes credit checks on every purchase, restricting the use of our services if repayments are missed, the first ever credit-opt out tool and reporting BNPL usage to credit reference agencies.\n\n99%\nPayments repaid\n\nLess than one 1%\nDefault rate\n\n60%\nPay us back early\n\nKlarna's payment products\nPay in 3\n\nPay in 3 is our most popular product. It splits a purchase into 3 equal parts. The first part is paid at the time of purchase, the second after 30 days and the third after 60 days, no fee, no interest This is perfect when buying an unexpected but necessary item, like a replacement washing machine.\n\nPay Later\n\nPay later gives shoppers 30 days interest-free before they have to pay. It means consumers can try before they buy. It gives added safety to online purchases, customers do not have to release the money from their bank account until they have received the item.\n\nPay in full\n\nPay in full l aunched in 2021 and growing faster than any other product, is a super smoooth instant debit purchase offering customers the opportunity to pay at the time of purchase. Globally, pay in full accounts for over a quarter of our transactions.\n\nFinancing\n\nMaking up just 1% of Klarna purchases in the UK. Financing is Klarna\u2019s answer to a more traditional regulated credit product for higher-ticket items. The majority of these payment plans last between 6-24 months. This is offered interest-free or interest-bearing depending on the retailer. Klarna's Financing plan has an APR ranging from 0-21.9%.\n\n99% of transactions are interest free\n\nAny late payment is a failure on us\nIt\u2019s not in our interest to lend to people who can\u2019t pay us back as it impacts our business negatively. We encourage on time payments with multiple reminders. We will send up to 4 reminders to a customer ahead of their payment due date. In that time customers can extend the due date of their payments for free which gives them 10 additional days to pay.\n\nWe\u2019ll send a reminder on the day a payment is due and another reminder two days after a payment is missed. We may charge a late fee of up to \u00a35 if any payment remains unpaid after 7 days, the total of late fees charged on an order will never exceed 25% of the total order.\n\nWe never charge more than two late fees per order. We will continue to send reminders. After 4 months we will tell the customer we will pass their order to a FCA approved debt collection agency who will attempt to make contact through phone, text, letter and email, the customer will no longer be able to use Klarna to make a payment.\n\nKlarna's late payment statistics\nIn 2023, 95% of Klarna\u2019s purchases were paid on time or early. Our late fee rates and debt collection rates are declining over time. This is a testament to Klarna\u2019s business model and underscores our consumers pay responsibly and on time. While the banks report jumps in credit card defaults.\n\n Wikipink Late fee graph\nAll age groups\n\nShare of UK Pay in 3 orders which had a missed payment and may have incurred a late fee\nWIkipink DC\nAll age groups\n\nShare of UK Pay in 3 orders that have been referred to debt collection\nWikipink Late fee\nAll age groups\n\nShare of UK Pay Later orders which had a missed payment and may have incurred a late fee\nWikipink DC rate Pay Later\nAll age groups\n\nShare of UK Pay Later orders that have been referred to debt collection\n(UK) Wikipink Pie NEW\nMore than half of our orders are paid early\nIn 2023, over half (60%) of purchases were paid back early, 35% were paid on time, and 5% were late. In comparison half of UK of credit card consumers do not pay off their balance each month and incur interest.\n\n(UK) Wikipink New Waterfall\nJust 0.61 % of orders are handed over to a DCA\nIn 2023, 5.18% of orders received a late fee, 4.6% of total orders were paid after receiving a late fee and 0.61% of orders were handed over to an FCA-regulated Debt Collector.\n\n(UK) Wikipink Late fee Service\nLate fees encourage on time payments\nWe charge the lowest late fees we can to ensure they act as a deterrent to missed payments, but that they do not become a large proportion of our income. That\u2019s why our late fees are the lowest in the credit industry.\n\nCredit card companies employ many dirty tactics to keep milking more and more money out of their customers\nWikipink BNPL vs creditcards\n(UK) Age brackets\nThere is no typical Klarna customer, everyone uses Klarna\nThe average age of a customer in the UK is 36, and continues to trend upwards as consumers of all generations realise the benefits of BNPL.\n\nOur consumers love us\nKlarna is rated 4.9 on the App Store\u2014higher than traditional banks and credit cards, which struggle to pass 4.8. Don\u2019t believe us? Take a look at Barclays, HSBC, or American Express.\n\nOur complaint rate is 136 for every 1,000,000 transactions\n\n(UK) Wikipink complaints new version\nTraditional banks report complaint rates for credit cards and bank accounts to the FCA per 1,000 accounts.
