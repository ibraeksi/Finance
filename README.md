# Finance & Banking Projects
With the rise of digital banking, data science has been integrated even more for daily operations in the finance and banking sector.

In this page, I will be sharing the projects that I have worked on using publicly available financial data.

## Holistic value-based brand strategy platform
During the final 2 weeks of the Le Wagon intensive Data Science & AI Bootcamp, I took part in a team of 4 to complete a final project. We built a multi-page AI-powered app for analyzing customer perception, brand communication and competition that would enable data-informed brand differentiation and distinct communicative positioning.
