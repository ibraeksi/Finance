# Le Wagon Projects
I attended the Le Wagon intensive Data Science & AI Bootcamp in the summer of 2025. In this page, I will be sharing the projects that I have worked on during my time at the bootcamp.

## Holistic value-based brand strategy platform
During the final 2 weeks of the bootcamp, I took part in a team of 4 to complete a final project. We built a multi-page AI-powered app for analyzing customer perception, brand communication and competition that would enable data-informed brand differentiation and distinct communicative positioning.
